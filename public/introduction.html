        <p>Diabetes, a long-term global health challenge, has become a serious problem in the lives of millions of people. It occurs when the body is unable to produce enough insulin effectively, which result in persistent high blood glucose levels. The disease is not only a medical problem, but also a social challenge. Furthermore, it can lead to a variety of serious health consequences including heart disease, kidney disease, vision loss and nerve damage. Around the world, medical experts are working to find new and faster treatment of diabetes. MyHealthTeams identified specific symptoms for people with diabetes as fatigue (65%), numbness (53%), frequent urination (52%), itching (46%), dry feet (44%), extreme thirst (38%), and neuropathy (31%). At the same time, the impact of diabetes on daily life is significant, with the main challenges reported by survey respondents including: difficulty sleeping at night (51%), depression/anxiety (45%), difficulty engaging in sexual activity (43%), difficulty doing daily chores (41%), and interference with social life (33%) (MyHealthTeams). At the same time, there is a common misconception in society, which is the belief that the onset of diabetes is solely due to someone's fault. Whether it's a lack of discipline in one's own habits or the resources or support provided by others, the process of managing diabetes is fraught with pain and blame, and the patient themselves may not realize what they did wrong to cause the condition, but instead blame some genetic predisposition or the prompting of others. Having such thoughts in such a treatment environment can only make diabetes more difficult to prevent. This misconception has led to the discovery of a way to treat diabetes and other chronic diseases by using empathy, which can deal with the physical and mental problems at the same time. Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of others. It is believed that empathy plays an important role in the treatment of diabetics. It not only reduces the patient's stress and suffering, but also positively affects the outcome of treatment. However, views on using empathy in medical practice are not agreed. Some people concern that an empathy may increase the pressure on physicians to provide more care to their patients, which may have a negative impact on treatment outcomes.
