                <p>According to AMA, there are several reasons for intentional nonadherence, where patients choose not to follow their medication regimen based on their experiences and beliefs:</p>
          
                <p>1.	Fear: Patients might avoid medication due to fear of side effects, either experienced firsthand or observed in others.</p>
                <p>2.	Cost: High costs can prevent patients from filling prescriptions or might lead them to ration their medication.</p>
                <p>3.	Misunderstanding: Patients may not adhere if they do not comprehend the necessity or potential side effects of the medication, or if they do not see immediate results.</p>
                <p>4.   Too many medications: A complex regimen can discourage adherence; simplifying dosing schedules or using combination drugs may help.</p>
                <p>5.   Lack of symptoms: Patients who do not experience symptoms might not see the need for continued medication, especially once symptoms improve.</p>
                <p>6.   Mistrust: Skepticism towards the pharmaceutical industry and physician motives can deter patients from taking their medications as prescribed.<p>
                <p>7.   Worry: Concerns about dependency can lead to nonadherence, highlighting the importance of effective communication between patients and physicians.</p>
                <p>8.	Depression: Depressed patients may neglect their medication, requiring sensitive engagement from healthcare providers to address adherence issues.</p>

                    <p>This document summarizes a study investigating the relationship between physician empathy and clinical outcomes in patients with diabetes. The study involved 891 patients with diabetes and 29 family physicians at a university-affiliated outpatient facility. Physician empathy levels were measured using the Jefferson Empathy Scale, and patients' clinical outcomes were assessed based on their hemoglobin A1c and LDL cholesterol levels.

                        The results showed that patients of physicians with high empathy scores had significantly better control of hemoglobin A1c and LDL cholesterol levels compared to patients of physicians with low empathy scores. This suggests that the higher the physician's empathy, the better the patient's control of diabetes.
                        
                        The study concluded that empathy is an important component of medical competence and has a positive impact on clinical outcomes. The study supports the need to incorporate empathy training in medical education to improve the quality of patient care.</p>
